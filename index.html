                To address the additional complexity of this problem, recent works have leveraged information from vision-language models (VLMs) trained on large text-images datasets for 
                the task. These methods learn an independent classifier for each object (class), overlooking correlations in their occurrences. Such co-occurrences can be captured from the
                 training data as conditional probabilities between a pair of classes. We propose a framework to extend the independent classifiers by incorporating the 
                 co-occurrence information for object pairs to improve the performance of independent classifiers. We use a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to enforce the 
                 conditional probabilities between classes, by refining the initial estimates derived from image and text sources obtained using VLMs. We validate our method on four MLR
                  datasets, where our approach outperforms all state-of-the-art methods.</i></p>

                 using only unlabeled data. This challenging problem requires accurately estimating the similarity between data points, which is used 
                 to supervise a deep network. For this purpose, we propose to model the high-dimensional data manifold using a piecewise-linear 
                 approximation, with each low-dimensional linear piece approximating the data manifold in a small neighborhood of a point. 
                 These neighborhoods are used to estimate similarity between data points. We empirically show that this similarity estimate correlates 
                 better with the ground truth than the similarity estimates of current state-of-the-art techniques. We also show that proxies, commonly
                  used in supervised metric learning, can be used to model the piecewise-linear manifold in an unsupervised setting, helping improve 
                  performance. Our method outperforms existing unsupervised metric learning approaches on standard zero-shot image retrieval benchmarks.</i></p>

                <p align="justify"> <i id="ldgest_abs">Gestures form an important medium of communication between humans and machines. An overwhelming
                  majority of existing gesture recognition methods are tailored to
                  a scenario where humans and machines are located very close
                  to each other. This short-distance assumption does not hold
                  true for several types of interactions, for example gesture-based
                  interactions with a floor cleaning robot or with a drone. Methods
                  made for short-distance recognition are unable to perform
                  well on long-distance recognition due to gestures occupying
                  only a small portion of the input data. Their performance is
                  especially worse in resource constrained settings where they
                  are not able to effectively focus their limited compute on the
                  gesturing subject. We propose a novel, accurate and efficient
                  method for the recognition of gestures from longer distances. It
                  uses a dynamic neural network to select features from gesturecontaining
                  spatial regions of the input sensor data for further
                  processing. This helps the network focus on features important
                  for gesture recognition while discarding background features
                  early on, thus making it more compute efficient compared
                  to other techniques. We demonstrate the performance of our
                  method on the LD-ConGR long-distance dataset where it
                  outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on recognition

                <p align="justify"> <i id="pal_abs">The goal of pool-based active learning is to judiciously select a fixed-sized subset of
                  unlabeled samples from a pool to query an oracle for their labels, in order to maximize
                  the accuracy of a supervised learner. However, the unsaid requirement that the oracle
                  should always assign correct labels is unreasonable for most situations. We propose an
                  active learning technique for deep neural networks that is more robust to mislabeling than
                  the previously proposed techniques. Previous techniques rely on the task network itself
                  to estimate the novelty of the unlabeled samples, but learning the task (generalization)
                  and selecting samples (out-of-distribution detection) can be conflicting goals. We use
                  a separate network to score the unlabeled samples for selection. The scoring network
                  relies on self-supervision for modeling the distribution of the labeled samples to reduce
                  the dependency on potentially noisy labels. To counter the paucity of data, we also deploy
                  another head on the scoring network for regularization via multi-task learning and use an
                  unusual self-balancing hybrid scoring function. Furthermore, we divide each query into
                  sub-queries before labeling to ensure that the query has diverse samples. In addition to
                  having a higher tolerance to mislabeling of samples by the oracle, the resultant technique
                  also produces competitive accuracy in the absence of label noise. The technique also
                  handles the introduction of new classes on-the-fly well by temporarily increasing the
                  sampling rate of these classes. We make our code publicly available at https://

                signals at rates less than their Nyquist rates and attempting to reconstruct them after sample acquisition. 
                Most such algorithms have parameters, for example the regularization parameter in LASSO, which need to be chosen carefully for optimal 
                performance. These parameters can be chosen based on assumptions on the noise level or signal sparsity, but this knowledge may often be 
                unavailable. In such cases, cross validation (CV) can be used to choose these parameters in a purely data-driven fashion. Previous work 
                analyzing the use of CV in CS has been based on the ‚Ñì2 cross-validation error with Gaussian measurement noise. But it is well known that the ‚Ñì2 
                error is not robust to impulse noise and provides a poor estimate of the recovery error, failing to choose the best parameter. Here we propose 
                using the ‚Ñì1‚àíCV error which provides substantial performance benefits given impulse measurement noise. Most importantly, we provide a detailed 
                theoretical analysis and error bounds for the use of ‚Ñì1‚àíCV error in CS reconstruction. We show that with high probability, choosing the parameter
                 that yields the minimum ‚Ñì1‚àíCV error is equivalent to choosing the minimum recovery error (which is not observable in practice). To our best 
                 knowledge, this is the first paper which theoretically analyzes ‚Ñì1 -based CV in CS.</i></p>

            <p align="justify"> <i id="pcfb_abs">Principal Component Filter Bank (PCFB) is considered optimal in terms of coding gain for speciÔ¨Åcconditions. 
              P P Vaidyanathan stated that coding gain does not necessarily always increase with the increase inthe number of bands. However, very few attempts are made 
              in the literature to go beyond the conÔ¨Ånes of work done by P P Vaidyanathan. We present analytic proofs for the monotonicity of speciÔ¨Åc shapes of PSDs.
               This papers also derives properties of coding gain of PCFBs, which brings the new insights on the coding gain of Principal Component Filter Banks.</i></p>

          <p align="justify"> <i id="qr_abs">We propose a novel algorithm for using Hopfield
            networks to denoise QR codes. Hopfield networks have mostly been
            used as a noise tolerant memory or to solve difficult combinatorial
            problems. One of the major drawbacks in their use in noise tolerant
            associative memory is their low capacity of storage, scaling only
            linearly with the number of nodes in the network. A larger capacity
            therefore requires a larger number of nodes, thereby reducing the
            speed of convergence of the network in addition to increasing
            hardware costs for acquiring more precise data to be fed to a larger
            number of nodes. Our paper proposes a new algorithm to allow the
            use of several Hopfield networks in parallel thereby increasing the
            cumulative storage capacity of the system many times as compared
            to a single Hopfield network. Our algorithm would also be much
            faster than a larger single Hopfield network with the same total
            capacity. This enables their use in applications like denoising QR
            codes, which we have demonstrated in our paper. We then test our
            network on a large set of QR code images with different types of
            noise and demonstrate that such a system of Hopfield networks can
            be used to denoise and recognize QR codes in real time.</i></p>
