                <p align="justify"> <i id="ldgest_abs">Gestures form an important medium of communication between humans and machines. An overwhelming
                  majority of existing gesture recognition methods are tailored to
                  a scenario where humans and machines are located very close
                  to each other. This short-distance assumption does not hold
                  true for several types of interactions, for example gesture-based
                  interactions with a floor cleaning robot or with a drone. Methods
                  made for short-distance recognition are unable to perform
                  well on long-distance recognition due to gestures occupying
                  only a small portion of the input data. Their performance is
                  especially worse in resource constrained settings where they
                  are not able to effectively focus their limited compute on the
                  gesturing subject. We propose a novel, accurate and efficient
                  method for the recognition of gestures from longer distances. It
                  uses a dynamic neural network to select features from gesturecontaining
                  spatial regions of the input sensor data for further
                  processing. This helps the network focus on features important
                  for gesture recognition while discarding background features
                  early on, thus making it more compute efficient compared
                  to other techniques. We demonstrate the performance of our
                  method on the LD-ConGR long-distance dataset where it
                  outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on recognition
                  accuracy and compute efficiency.</i></p>

                <p align="justify"> <i id="pal_abs">The goal of pool-based active learning is to judiciously select a fixed-sized subset of
                  unlabeled samples from a pool to query an oracle for their labels, in order to maximize
                  the accuracy of a supervised learner. However, the unsaid requirement that the oracle
                  should always assign correct labels is unreasonable for most situations. We propose an
                  active learning technique for deep neural networks that is more robust to mislabeling than
                  the previously proposed techniques. Previous techniques rely on the task network itself
                  to estimate the novelty of the unlabeled samples, but learning the task (generalization)
                  and selecting samples (out-of-distribution detection) can be conflicting goals. We use
                  a separate network to score the unlabeled samples for selection. The scoring network
                  relies on self-supervision for modeling the distribution of the labeled samples to reduce
                  the dependency on potentially noisy labels. To counter the paucity of data, we also deploy
                  another head on the scoring network for regularization via multi-task learning and use an
                  unusual self-balancing hybrid scoring function. Furthermore, we divide each query into
                  sub-queries before labeling to ensure that the query has diverse samples. In addition to
                  having a higher tolerance to mislabeling of samples by the oracle, the resultant technique
                  also produces competitive accuracy in the absence of label noise. The technique also
                  handles the introduction of new classes on-the-fly well by temporarily increasing the
                  sampling rate of these classes. We make our code publicly available at https://

              <p align="justify"> <i id="l1_cv_abs">Compressed sensing (CS) involves sampling 
                signals at rates less than their Nyquist rates and attempting to reconstruct them after sample acquisition. 
                Most such algorithms have parameters, for example the regularization parameter in LASSO, which need to be chosen carefully for optimal 
                performance. These parameters can be chosen based on assumptions on the noise level or signal sparsity, but this knowledge may often be 
                unavailable. In such cases, cross validation (CV) can be used to choose these parameters in a purely data-driven fashion. Previous work 
                analyzing the use of CV in CS has been based on the ℓ2 cross-validation error with Gaussian measurement noise. But it is well known that the ℓ2 
                error is not robust to impulse noise and provides a poor estimate of the recovery error, failing to choose the best parameter. Here we propose 
                using the ℓ1−CV error which provides substantial performance benefits given impulse measurement noise. Most importantly, we provide a detailed 
                theoretical analysis and error bounds for the use of ℓ1−CV error in CS reconstruction. We show that with high probability, choosing the parameter
                 that yields the minimum ℓ1−CV error is equivalent to choosing the minimum recovery error (which is not observable in practice). To our best 
                 knowledge, this is the first paper which theoretically analyzes ℓ1 -based CV in CS.</i></p>
